In Java, compilation is the process of translating human-readable code into machine-readable code that can be executed by the computer.
On the other hand, runtime refers to the period during which the program is executing and performing its intended tasks.

Compile time in Java:

=>Compilation happens before the program is executed, and it is a one-time process.
=>The compiler checks the syntax of the code and ensures that it is valid Java code.
=>The compiler also performs type checking, which means that it verifies that the data types used in the code are compatible.
=>Compilation produces bytecode, which is the machine-readable code that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).


Run time in Java:
=> The program is executed during runtime, which is the period when the program is actually running.
=> During runtime, the JVM interprets the bytecode and executes the instructions.
=> The JVM performs runtime checks, such as checking for null pointer exceptions, array index out of bounds, and other types of runtime errors.
=> During runtime, the program interacts with the computer's resources, such as the memory and the CPU, and performs the tasks it was designed to do.
In summary, compile time is the period when the program is compiled, and runtime is the period when the program is executed.
During compile time, the compiler checks the code and produces bytecode. During runtime, the JVM interprets the bytecode and executes the program.
