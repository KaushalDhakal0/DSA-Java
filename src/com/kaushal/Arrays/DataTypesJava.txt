In Java, there are two types of data: primitive and non-primitive (also known as reference or object types). Here is a list of the primitive and non-primitive data types in Java:

Primitive data types:

=> byte - 8-bit signed integer
=> short - 16-bit signed integer
=> int - 32-bit signed integer
=> long - 64-bit signed integer
=> float - 32-bit floating-point number
=> double - 64-bit floating-point number
=> char - 16-bit Unicode character
=> boolean - true or false value


Non-primitive data types:

=> String - a sequence of characters
=> Array - a collection of elements of the same data type
=> Class - a blueprint or template for creating objects
=> Interface - a collection of abstract methods that can be implemented by a class
=> Enum - a type with a fixed set of constants
=> Object - the superclass of all other classes in Java

=> Note that primitive data types are stored directly in memory, while non-primitive data types are stored as references to objects in memory.
